# What is cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage,
applications, and other IT resources
• Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
• You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you
need
• You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
• Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services
• Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware
required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need
via a web application.

## The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing


• On-demand self service:
    • Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
• Broad network access:
    • Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
• Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
    • Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
    • Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
• Rapid elasticity and scalability:
    • Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
    • Quickly and easily scale based on demand
• Measured service:
    • Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

## Types of cloud computing

IaaS 
    - Provide buiding blocks for cloud IT
    - Provides network computers, datastore space
    - Highest level of flexibilty
    - Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT

Platform as a Service PaaS
    - Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
    - Focus on the deployment and management of your applications

Software as a Service (SaaS)
    - Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider


Examples
IAAS   
    - Amazon EC2
    - GCP, Azxure, Rackspace, Linode

PAAS
    - elastic beanstlak
    - herokuy

SAAS 
    - Reckniztion machine learning
